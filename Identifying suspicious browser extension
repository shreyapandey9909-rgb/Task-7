The process involved identifying potentially malicious or unnecessary browser add-ons, understanding the risks of browser-based threats, and applying security best practices.

 Objectives

- Review all installed browser extensions
- Check their permissions and user reviews
- Identify and remove suspicious or unused extensions
- Analyze how malicious extensions can compromise user security
- Document actions taken and improvements noticed

# Step-by-Step Process

 1. Open Extension Manager

Opened the browser’s extension manager:

- Microsoft Edge: edge://extensions/

2. Review Installed Extensions

Manually reviewed each installed extension:

- Checked purpose and usage
- Verified if it was still needed
- Made note of unknown or untrusted extensions

3. Check Permissions and Reviews

For each extension:

- Clicked “Details” to see permissions
- Checked what data it could access (e.g., “Read browsing history”)
- Viewed user reviews on the Chrome Web Store

Flagged extensions that:
- Requested unnecessary or risky permissions
- Had low ratings or bad user feedback
- Came from unknown publishers

4. Identify Unused or Suspicious Extensions

Identified the following issues:

| Extension Name       | Issue                             | Action     |

| Google docs offline  | Not used in 6+ months              | Removed    |

| Grammarly            | Trusted, frequently used           | Kept       |

5. Remove Suspicious/Unnecessary Extensions

Used the “Remove” button next to each extension.

Removed Extensions:

- `PDF Converter Pro`

 6. Restart Browser & Monitor Improvements

After removal:

- Restarted the browser
